# Change log

### 1.5.7

- Fix a bug where empty `apollographql-client-name` and
  `apollographql-client-version` headers were being included with requests
  when they weren't set in the `context` based `clientAwareness` object.  <br/>
  [@hwillson](http://github.com/hwillson) in [#872](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/pull/872)

### 1.5.6

- If `name` or `version` client awareness settings are found in the
  incoming `operation` `context`, they'll be extracted and added as headers
  to all outgoing requests. The header names used (`apollographql-client-name`
  and `apollographql-client-version`) line up with the associated Apollo Server
  changes made in https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1960.  <br/>
