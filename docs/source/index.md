This is the official guide for using Apollo Links in your Apollo app using the [apollo-link](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link) package.

It is a convenient way to customize Apollo Client to the needs of your application while providing a small API to learn. To get started, check out [installing the library](initialization.html)
