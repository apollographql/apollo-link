// the actual meat of a Link, the Linker is a function that, when
// given an OperationRequest (and optionally a previous link), it
// will return an Observable which will eventually notify subscribers
// of either a LinkResult or nothing
// The `prev` arugment allows for dynamically building chains of complex
// operations flows. Instead of passing a `next` function, or the full
// Observable, we pass the Link interface so other links can perform
// functions on the OperationRequest and Link itself. For instance,
// a Link could add a time marker prior to request using `.map`, and
// then, given the `.request` function, it could read that timer and
// perform a side effect logging on an internal subscription while passing
// the original Link down to the next chain. I think this could lead
// to a ton of interesting use cases without a heavy API (excite)
